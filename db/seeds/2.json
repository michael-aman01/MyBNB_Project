    "description": "Casa Canal is a relaxing oasis surrounded by tropical plants and a Beautiful Canal.  The canal is home to manatees, squirrels, bright green Iguanas, and at times wild green Parakeets in the tree canopy, You can enjoy all this from your private hot tub.\n\nSpend a quiet time fishing under the gumbo limbo tree while enjoying the tropical breeze. The backyard faces the Canal to the east and in the morning you can often enjoy a beautiful sunrise and sometimes in the evening an impressive full moon.\n\n\nCasa Canal, from the moment you walk in, you get a feeling of spacious, relaxing, non-cluttered space yet a place that makes you feel comfortable right away. The house is an open plan design with water views visible from all rooms. It has 3 large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a large kitchen with a bar, 55\u201d HDTV, and plenty of seating.
